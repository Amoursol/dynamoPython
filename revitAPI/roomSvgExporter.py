for large projects with lots of room or space data it is useful to analyse in
a business inteligence or data visualisation tool such as ms power bi.
To visualise rooms in power bi they can be cnoverted to svg and read
with the synoptic panel in power bi. This script collects rooms for a
single selected level and creates an svg file from room boundaries
